I got credential from Youtube and accessed the Youtube API to achieve data. 
I analyzed information about views, subscribers, number of video uploads of 
channels to find out which channels got the overall highest popularity among all the channnels. 
I also analyzed on values such as views per subscriber, views per video and Comments per Video to further measure the popularity.
